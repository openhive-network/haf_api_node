    <h2>HAF pgBadger Config</h2>
    <p>
      If you're seeing these instructions, it means you have never run pgBadger.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must run pgBadger periodically to parse your PostgreSQL log files and generate the 
      reports as static HTML files.  Once you have run pgBadger, the reports will show up
      <a href="../pgbadger">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To run pgBadger, launch:
      <pre>
        docker compose --profile=pgbadger up
      </pre>
      and wait for it to finish.  It can take several minutes when there are a lot of logs to
      parse, and it may print anything on screen until it's done.
