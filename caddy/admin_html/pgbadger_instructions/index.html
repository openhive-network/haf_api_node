    <h2>HAF pgBadger Config</h2>
    <p>
      If you're seeing these instructions, it means you have never run pgBadger.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must enable pgBadger by adding the <tt>pgbadger</tt> profile to your <tt>COMPOSE_PROFILES=</tt>
      in your <tt>.env</tt> file, then running <tt>docker compose up -d</tt> again.  This will configure
      the stack to run pgBadger once a day at UTC midnight.  After it has run, it will replace this page
      with the pgBadger results.
